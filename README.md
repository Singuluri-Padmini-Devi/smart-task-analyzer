## 📊 Algorithm Design

### Priority Scoring Formula

The core algorithm computes a priority score (0-100) for each task using four weighted components:

```
Score = (w_u × U) + (w_i × I) + (w_e × E) + (w_d × D)
```

Where:
- **U** = Urgency Score (0-2 scale, >1 for overdue)
- **I** = Importance Score (0-1 scale)
- **E** = Effort Score (0-1 scale, higher for quick wins)
- **D** = Dependency Score (0-1 scale, higher if many tasks blocked)

### Component Details

#### 1. **Urgency (U)**
Calculated based on days until due date:

- **Overdue tasks**: `U = 1.0 + min(days_late / 7, 1.0)` (up to 2.0)
- **Due today**: `U = 1.0`
- **Due within 3 days**: `U = 0.9 - 1.0` (linear scale)
- **Future tasks**: `U = max(0, 1 - days_left / 30)` (30-day decay)
- **No due date**: `U = 0.5` (neutral)

**Design Decision**: Overdue tasks get a bonus score (>1.0) to ensure critical visibility. The 30-day decay prevents far-future tasks from being ignored completely.

#### 2. **Importance (I)**
User-provided rating on 1-10 scale, normalized:

```python
I = (importance - 1) / 9
```

**Design Decision**: Linear normalization preserves user intent while fitting the 0-1 scale.

#### 3. **Effort (E)**
Rewards "quick wins" using logarithmic scaling:

```python
E = 1 - (log(estimated_hours + 1) / log(max_hours + 1))
```

**Design Decision**: Logarithmic scale prevents extreme bias toward micro-tasks while still rewarding efficiency. A 1-hour task scores higher than an 8-hour task, but not 8× higher.

#### 4. **Dependencies (D)**
Measures how many other tasks are blocked:

```python
D = min(1.0, num_dependents / max_dependents)
```

**Design Decision**: Tasks blocking others get priority to unblock team progress. Normalized to 0-1 based on maximum dependents in the task set.

### Strategy Presets

Four predefined weight configurations:

| Strategy | Urgency | Importance | Effort | Dependencies | Use Case |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Smart Balance** | 0.35 | 0.35 | 0.15 | 0.15 | Default, balanced approach |
| **Fastest Wins** | 0.15 | 0.20 | 0.50 | 0.15 | Maximize quick completions |
| **High Impact** | 0.15 | 0.60 | 0.10 | 0.15 | Focus on important work |
| **Deadline Driven** | 0.60 | 0.25 | 0.05 | 0.10 | Urgent/time-sensitive mode |

**Design Decision**: Customizable strategies allow users to adapt prioritization to their current work context (e.g., end-of-sprint = deadline driven).

### Tie-Breaking Rules

When tasks have equal scores, secondary sorting applies:

1. **More dependents first** (unblock others)
2. **Fewer hours first** (quick wins)
3. **Earlier due date** (urgency)

## 🛡️ Edge Case Handling

### 1. **Circular Dependencies**

**Detection**: Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) with color marking to detect cycles in the dependency graph.

```python
# White (0) = unvisited
# Gray (1) = in current path (cycle if revisited)
# Black (2) = fully processed
```

**Handling**:
- Cycles are detected and reported in warnings
- Tasks in cycles are flagged with `in_circular_dependency: true`
- Dependency scoring continues (doesn't break analysis)
- Warning message shows the cycle path

**Example**: Tasks A→B→C→A would trigger: "⚠️ Circular dependency detected: A -> B -> C -> A"

### 2. **Missing/Invalid Data**

| Issue | Handling | Default Value |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Missing `id` | Skip task, add warning | N/A (required) |
| Missing `title` | Use default, warn | `"Task {id}"` |
| Missing `due_date` | Assign neutral urgency | `U = 0.5` |
| Missing `estimated_hours` | Default to 1 hour | `1` |
| Missing `importance` | Default to medium | `5` |
| Out-of-range `importance` | Clamp to 1-10 | `max(1, min(10, value))` |
| Negative `estimated_hours` | Clamp to 0 | `max(0, value)` |
| Invalid date format | Treat as missing, warn | `U = 0.5` |

**Design Decision**: Graceful degradation allows partial analysis rather than complete failure. All issues are reported in the `warnings` array.

### 3. **Missing Dependency IDs**

**Scenario**: Task A depends on non-existent task "Z"

**Handling**:
- Warning added: "Missing dependency IDs referenced: Z"
- Dependency score for A is not penalized
- Analysis continues normally

**Design Decision**: Missing dependencies might be tasks not yet created or external dependencies, so we don't penalize tasks for referencing them.

### 4. **Overdue Tasks**

**Special Treatment**:
- Urgency score exceeds 1.0 (bonus of up to +1.0)
- Explanation includes: "⚠️ OVERDUE by X days"
- Ensures critical visibility even with low importance

**Formula**:
```python
if days_late > 0:
    U = 1.0 + min(days_late / 7, 1.0)
```

**Design Decision**: Late tasks compound in urgency weekly (1 week late = +1.0 bonus). This prevents old tasks from becoming infinitely prioritized while ensuring they stay visible.

### 5. **Zero Effort Tasks**

**Handling**:
- `estimated_hours = 0` → Effort score = 1.0 (instant task)
- Avoids division by zero in logarithmic formula
- Treated as "ultimate quick win"

### 6. **No Dependencies**

**Handling**:
- Tasks with zero dependents → Dependency score = 0
- `max_dependents = 0` for entire set → All dependency scores = 0
- Analysis continues with other factors weighted proportionally

   - Expected: Balanced scoring

2. **Overdue Task**:
   - Set `due_date` to past date
   - Expected: High score with "OVERDUE" warning

3. **Circular Dependency**:
   ```json
   [
     {"id": "t1", "dependencies": ["t2"]},
     {"id": "t2", "dependencies": ["t1"]}
   ]
   ```
   - Expected: Warning with cycle path

4. **Missing Data**:
   - Omit `due_date` or `importance`
   - Expected: Defaults applied, analysis continues

5. **Quick Win**:
   - `estimated_hours: 0.5`, `importance: 5`
   - Use "Fastest Wins" strategy
   - Expected: High priority despite medium importance

### Manual API Testing

Using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/analyze/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @samples/tasks.json
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Custom Weights

Override strategy weights via API:

```json
{
  "weights": {
    "u": 0.5,
    "i": 0.3,
    "e": 0.1,
    "d": 0.1
  },
  "tasks": [...]
}
```

**Note**: Weights don't need to sum to 1.0 (normalization happens internally), but should be between 0-1.

## 📈 Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. **In-Memory Processing vs Database**
**Decision**: Process tasks in-memory (no Django models/database)

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Faster development for assessment
- ✅ Simpler deployment (no migrations)
- ✅ Stateless API (RESTful)
- ❌ No persistence (acceptable for demo)

### 2. **Logarithmic Effort Scaling**
**Decision**: Use `log(hours)` instead of linear `1/hours`

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Prevents extreme bias toward 0.1hr tasks
- ✅ More realistic "diminishing returns" for larger tasks
- ✅ Avoids division by zero naturally

**Alternative Considered**: Linear scaling (`1 - hours/max`) - too aggressive on small tasks

### 3. **Urgency Bonus for Overdue**
**Decision**: Allow urgency >1.0 (up to 2.0)

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Ensures overdue tasks remain visible
- ✅ Bounded growth prevents ancient tasks from dominating
- ❌ Could mask low-importance old tasks

**Alternative Considered**: Cap at 1.0 - overdue tasks got lost with low importance

### 4. **Circular Dependency Non-Blocking**
**Decision**: Detect and warn, but continue analysis

**Rationale**:
- ✅ User can still see prioritization
- ✅ Warnings clearly indicate the issue
- ❌ Doesn't prevent invalid dependency chains

**Alternative Considered**: Fail analysis - too restrictive for exploratory use

### 5. **Four Fixed Strategies**
**Decision**: Predefined strategy presets vs full custom weights

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Easier UX for non-technical users
- ✅ Still allows advanced users to send custom weights via API
- ✅ Clear semantic meaning (Deadline Driven vs manual `{u:0.6, ...}`)

## 📝 Commit History

The Git history follows a structured progression:

1. Initial setup (Django project, gitignore)
2. Backend core (scoring algorithm)
3. API endpoints (analyze, suggest)
4. Frontend UI (forms, results display)
5. Edge case handling (circular deps, validation)
6. Polish (README, sample data, styling)

## Design Decisions

### In-Memory Processing vs Database
This implementation processes tasks in-memory rather than persisting to a database.

**Rationale:**
- Assessment focuses on algorithm design and problem-solving
- Stateless API design (RESTful principles)
- Faster development and simpler deployment
- Easy to extend to database persistence if needed

### Advanced Algorithm
The scoring algorithm exceeds basic requirements by implementing:
- Multi-factor weighted scoring (4 configurable strategies)
- Bounded overdue penalties (prevents extreme scores)
- Logarithmic effort scaling (realistic quick-win calculations)
- DFS-based circular dependency detection
- Comprehensive edge case handling

See "Algorithm Design" section for detailed formulas.
